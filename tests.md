# Comprehensive Test Plan for WebAudio Library

## 1. Analysis of Current Test Coverage

### Existing Test Structure
- 50 tests currently implemented
- Using Vitest as the testing framework
- Utilizing standardized-audio-context-mock for WebAudio API mocking

### Identified Gaps
- Limited coverage of edge cases and error handling
- Lack of performance testing
- Insufficient integration tests between components
- Minimal testing of concurrent audio operations

## 2. Improvements to Existing Tests

- Enhance mock object usage for more realistic audio context simulation
- Implement more granular assertions to catch subtle audio processing errors
- Increase test coverage for different audio formats and configurations
- Add more comprehensive cleanup procedures after each test

## 3. New Test Cases

### Cacophony Class
- Test initialization with different AudioContext configurations
- Verify proper handling of unsupported AudioWorklet scenarios
- Test global volume control and muting functionality
- Validate listener orientation and position settings

### Sound Class
- Test loading of various audio formats (MP3, WAV, OGG)
- Verify correct behavior of looping with different loop counts
- Test seeking functionality, including edge cases (beginning, end, beyond duration)
- Validate cloning of Sound instances with different override configurations

### Playback Class
- Test pause and resume functionality at different playback points
- Verify correct application of playback rate changes
- Test behavior when rapidly switching between play, pause, and stop
- Validate proper cleanup of resources after playback ends

### Synth Class
- Test creation of different waveform types
- Verify frequency and detune adjustments
- Test addition and removal of audio filters
- Validate 3D audio positioning for synthesized sounds

### Group Class
- Test adding and removing sounds from a group
- Verify collective operations (play, stop, volume change) on grouped sounds
- Test ordered and random playback within a group
- Validate proper resource management for large groups of sounds

### Filters
- Test application of various filter types (lowpass, highpass, bandpass)
- Verify filter parameter adjustments (frequency, Q, gain)
- Test chaining multiple filters
- Validate filter behavior at extreme settings

## 4. Performance Testing

- Measure CPU usage during simultaneous playback of multiple sounds
- Test memory usage over time, especially with long audio streams
- Benchmark loading times for various audio file sizes and formats
- Evaluate performance impact of complex filter chains

## 5. Integration Testing

- Test interaction between Cacophony and Sound classes
- Verify proper integration of Synth with Group functionality
- Test combined usage of streamed and buffered audio sources
- Validate interaction between 3D audio positioning and global listener settings

## 6. Error Handling and Edge Cases

- Test behavior with invalid audio files or URLs
- Verify graceful handling of AudioContext suspension and resumption
- Test recovery from audio playback interruptions (e.g., system events)
