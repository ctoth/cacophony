/**
 * The Sound class represents an audio asset within a web application, providing a high-level interface
 * for loading, manipulating, and playing audio. It supports both buffer-based and media element-based audio,
 * allowing for efficient playback and manipulation of sound resources.
 *
 * A Sound instance can manage multiple Playback instances, which represent individual playbacks of the sound.
 * This allows for the same sound to be played multiple times simultaneously or with different settings (e.g., volume,
 * playback rate, spatial positioning). The Sound class provides methods to control these playbacks collectively or individually.
 *
 * Key features include:
 * - Loading audio from a URL or using a pre-loaded buffer.
 * - Playing, pausing, resuming, and stopping audio playback.
 * - Looping audio a specific number of times or infinitely.
 * - Adjusting volume, playback rate, and spatial positioning (for 3D audio).
 * - Applying audio filters for effects like reverb, equalization, etc.
 * - Cloning the Sound instance for independent manipulation and playback.
 *
 * The relationship between Sound and Playback is central to the design of the audio system. A Sound object acts as a container
 * and manager for one or more Playback objects. Each Playback object represents a single instance of the sound being played,
 * and can be controlled individually. This architecture allows for complex audio behaviors, such as playing multiple overlapping
 * instances of a sound with different settings, without requiring the user to manually manage each playback instance.
